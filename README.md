> StrongLoop Labs projects provide early access to advanced or experimental functionality.  In general, these projects may lack usability, completeness, documentation, and robustness, and may be outdated.
However, StrongLoop supports these projects: Paying customers can open issues using the StrongLoop customer support system (Zendesk), and community users can report bugs on GitHub.
